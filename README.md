<p align=center>Commander PRO Plugin for Rem0o's Fan Control</span>

<br />
<br />

## Main features

* Reads fan speed as both a % of power and raw RPM
* Updates fan speed as a % of power

## Todo

* Read temperature data from probes

## Installation

* Download the [plugin](https://github.com/iJacks1980/FanControl.CommanderPRO/releases/download/Latest/FanControl.CommanderPro.dll)
* Place the file "FanControl.CommanderPro.dll" into the Plugins folder of Fan Control.
	* Windows will probably block the file by default, simply right click and go to properties  then click the "Unblock this file" checkbox and press OK.
* Restart Fan Control.

## Known Issues

* If Corsair iCUE is installed you will get random data at best, nothing at worst.  Sadly the way that the hardware works means things have to be one or the other :(  If you need iCUE for the RGB I can recommend [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/)
* Temperature sensors not yet active.
